        <p>This certificate was obtained from volunteering, through NYP Primers CCA, and participating as a Motivator during National Day Parade 2024. Despite the higher commitment and the full day training on Saturdays for months, given the opportunity, I'd do it all again!</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/Leo.jpg" alt="Certificate">
        <p>I had volunteered in another event held by Leo club and had gotten the opportunity to be able to cheer up a group of elderly from Sunrise Home, by bringing them out to eat and shop. I was specifically more involved in the security part, ensuring they'd all cross through the roads safely despite the number of elderly and their assigned volunteers.</p>

      <div class="cert-item">
        <img src="../assets/images/Leo_home.jpg" alt="Certificate">
        <p>I had volunteered in a fundraising event held by Leo club (CCA), of which I am a subcommittee member in my second and third year, to raise awareness and collect donations for the seniors in Lion's home.</p>
